## Project Details🐱‍💻🐱‍💻
This is a management website where users can explore different categories of books, create their own collections via a favorite page, and also search for various kinds of books. I utilized Firebase for authentication and storage, Vue.js with TypeScript for the frontend, although my TypeScript skills are still a work in progress. I also used Tailwind CSS as my preferred CSS framework.

For now, users can only view each book's summary. The ability to preview books will be available as soon as I find the perfect API to fetch book previews. Thanks, fellow developers!
